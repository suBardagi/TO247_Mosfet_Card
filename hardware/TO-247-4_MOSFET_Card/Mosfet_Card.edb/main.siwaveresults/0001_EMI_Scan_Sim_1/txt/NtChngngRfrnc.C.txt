___CRITICAL NET CHANGING REFERENCE PLANE___
** INTRODUCTION **

The output from Rule 2 is divided into three parts. Part A shows nets found that have more than the 
'Number of Vias Allowed on Net'. Part B shows any of the vias in violation from Part A that do not 
have enough capacitors or vias connecting the two reference planes within an allowable 
distance. Part C shows if any of the vias from Part A cause return currents in other vias to exceed 
the 'Max Current Limit' specified.
