___CRITICAL NET CROSSING SPLIT REFERENCE PLANE___
** INTRODUCTION **

When a critical signal net crosses a gap in the power or ground plane, 
one of the following methods is required to allow the proper flow of 
return currents: 1) Two stitching capacitors across the gap within 
7.62 mm, or 
two pairs of decoupling capacitors between the power and ground planes 
within 7.62 mm of 
the crossing, one pair on each side of the gap on one side of the trace and the 
other pair on the other side of the trace.
